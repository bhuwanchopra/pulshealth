// Daily activity-summary (HKActivitySummary — the activity rings) export.
//
// Activity summaries are not HKSamples: they have no UUID, there is one per
// local calendar day, and the current day keeps changing as more activity is
// recorded. So like aggregates (see AggregateSync) they ride their own
// `{"activitySummary":...}` NDJSON line, the server upserts them keyed on date,
// and progress is a day watermark — not an HKQueryAnchor — advanced only after
// the server acks the upload (anchor-after-ack). Each run re-covers a trailing
// lookback (so recent days and today self-heal) plus a ~monthly full pass that
// repairs older edits. There is no observer/background-delivery for activity
// summaries, so they refresh on foreground/periodic/scheduled syncs plus an
// opportunistic hourly refresh at the tail of observer wakes
// (`refreshActivitySummaryIfStale`). They are the *first* phase of
// `syncAllEnabled`: one row per local day is seconds of work and the first
// thing a dashboard can show, so a long first backfill no longer runs to
// completion before any ring data exists.
