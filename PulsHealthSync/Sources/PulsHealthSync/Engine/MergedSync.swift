// Multi-type batching for incremental sync.
//
// `sync(type:)` uploads one type's page per request. That is right for a
// backfill, where every page is full and the four concurrent type-runs keep the
// network busy. It is badly wrong for observer-driven incremental sync, where
// production telemetry over 2026-06-14..2026-08-13 measured:
//
//   * 94% of sync wall time spent in upload, 6% in the HealthKit queries
//   * a median page of 7 samples / 1.2 KB that still cost ~1.5s of round trip
//   * 83% of pages carrying under 50 samples, moving 10.6% of the data while
//     consuming 79% of all upload time
//
// The cost is per-request, not per-sample, so the fix is fewer requests: fetch
// one page per type, pack the small ones together, and upload the packs.
//
// Anchor-after-ack is preserved exactly (see CLAUDE.md). A page is never split
// across batches, so each type's anchor advances after the single upload that
// carried its data was acked. When a batch fails, every anchor in it stays put
// and those types drop out of the run; the next run re-queries from the same
// anchor and re-sends the same samples, which is safe because every insert is
// ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING on sample UUID.
