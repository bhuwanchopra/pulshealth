// Failed-sign-in throttling for accounts mode.
//
// The same policy as server/ingest/ratelimit.go and server/api/ratelimit.go
// (copied, not shared, as those two are): a token bucket per key that ONLY
// failures draw from — a wrong password, an unknown or expired invite link,
// a wrong current password on the account page. A successful sign-in never
// costs a token. Once a bucket is empty the attempt is refused BEFORE the
// password is checked, so an attacker who is out of tokens learns nothing
// from the answer. Keep the constants in step with the Go copies.
//
// One difference from the Go copies, which compare a token in microseconds:
// a password check here takes tens of milliseconds of scrypt and a database
// round trip. Charging only after the check let a burst of parallel guesses
// all pass the check before the first was charged — at scrypt speed, not ten
// a minute. So an attempt takes its token up front, in the same synchronous
// step as the check (`takeAll`), and gets it back when the attempt turns out
// not to be a failure (`refundAll`): the net effect is still "failures only".
//
// Two kinds of key are charged per failure: the client address and, for a
// sign-in, the email address tried. The address bucket stops one client
// spraying many accounts; the email bucket stops many clients (or a forged
// address header) guessing at one account. The price is that a sustained
// attack on one email can keep its owner waiting too — refills take a
// minute, and the hosted instance sits behind Cloudflare's own rate limits.
//
// In-process memory, so it resets on restart and is per container: the
// viewer runs as one.
