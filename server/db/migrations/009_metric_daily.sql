-- puls:rerun
-- Unified daily "best guess of truth" per metric, per user (a VIEW, not a table:
-- always live, no backfill/refresh, no extra storage).
--
-- Two tiers, resolved per (type, user, day):
--   1. One canonical on-device aggregate series: sum for cumulative metrics or
--      average for discrete metrics, exactly 1 day, device_filter='all'.
--      HKStatisticsCollectionQuery applies HealthKit's cross-source dedup, so
--      this is the preferred truth. Hourly/weekly, min/max/mostRecent/duration,
--      and device-specific series never compete for the daily headline value.
--   2. Fallback for days/types not covered by tier 1: quantity_rollups, which is
--      derived from RAW samples (NOT deduped). For cumulative types that would
--      double-count across the iPhone + Watch, so pick the single highest-value
--      device that day; for discrete types take the cross-source weighted average.
--
-- Scope: types with a configured sum or average aggregate_series. Presence of
-- sum explicitly classifies the type as cumulative; otherwise average classifies
-- it as discrete. Types configured only with non-headline functions are omitted
-- instead of guessing their rollup semantics.
--
-- Day boundaries follow puls_time_zone(), i.e. the PULS_TIME_ZONE setting
-- (013_time_zone.sh stores it on the database; unset means UTC). It must
-- match the phone's zone: the on-device daily aggregates that form tier 1 are
-- computed in the phone's local calendar, and the Grafana dashboards read the
-- same function so every daily view agrees.
--
-- Idempotent (CREATE OR REPLACE) and marked `puls:rerun` on its first line:
-- the migrate service re-applies it whenever this file changes, so edit the
-- view definition here in place instead of adding a new numbered file. To
-- change the zone, set PULS_TIME_ZONE in .env and run the migrate service
-- again (013_time_zone.sh stores it; applies to new connections).

-- Include the not-yet-materialized portion of the current hour in reads from
-- quantity_rollups. Without real-time aggregation, metric_daily can lag until
-- the continuous-aggregate refresh policy completes the hour.
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW quantity_rollups SET (timescaledb.materialized_only = false);

-- The calendar zone every daily view/query is bucketed in. Read from the
-- puls.time_zone database setting (ALTER DATABASE … SET, written by
-- 013_time_zone.sh from PULS_TIME_ZONE); falls back to UTC when unset or
-- empty. STABLE, not IMMUTABLE: the setting can change between sessions.
-- Defined here rather than in a later file because migrations run in name
-- order and a view binds the functions it calls when it is created, so the
-- function has to exist before CREATE VIEW metric_daily below.

-- silently broke /v1/metrics/daily with permission-denied until 099 was re-run
-- by hand. Re-grant here so the documented "safe to re-run" sequence is.
-- Guarded: on a fresh database the roles do not exist yet (099 creates them,
