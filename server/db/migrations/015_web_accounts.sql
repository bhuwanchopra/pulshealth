-- Accounts for the web viewer, and the per-user surface its role reads.
--
-- With WEB_ACCOUNTS=true the viewer signs people in and shows each of them
-- only their own records. The database, not the viewer's WHERE clauses,
-- enforces that separation: the viewer connects as `web_app`
-- (099_read_roles.sh creates it when WEB_DB_PASSWORD is set), a role with no
-- grant on any table that holds health data. It reads them only through the
-- views in schema `web` below, each filtered on `puls_viewer_user()`, which
-- the viewer sets per transaction from the signed-in session
-- (SELECT set_config('puls.user_id', <uuid>, true)). A query that forgets its
-- `WHERE user_id = …` therefore returns that person's rows and nobody
-- else's, and a query run without the setting returns nothing.
--
-- Why views and not row-level security: TimescaleDB refuses
-- ALTER TABLE … ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY on a hypertable with columnstore
-- enabled ("operation not supported on hypertables that have columnstore
-- enabled"), and quantity_samples and workout_series_points are compressed
-- on every install. A security-barrier view gives the same guarantee for one
-- role without touching the tables, so Grafana, the product API and ingest
-- read and write exactly as before.
--
-- Nothing here changes behaviour until an operator turns accounts on: Basic
-- mode keeps connecting as `grafana` and never touches either schema.
-- See web/README.md, "Access control".

-- ── accounts ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Account identity lives here, never in `users`: users.name and users.email
-- are the phone's HealthKit profile, overwritten by every {"profile":…} line.
-- One account per user; the account's email is its sign-in name.

-- ── the per-user surface ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- One view per relation the viewer reads, named like the relation, so the
-- role's search_path (web, public — set by 099_read_roles.sh) resolves the
-- viewer's unqualified SQL to these for web_app and to the tables for
-- grafana. Owned by the migrating superuser, so they read the tables with
-- its rights; web_app gets SELECT on the views and on nothing beneath them.
--
-- security_barrier keeps a caller's own predicates from being evaluated
-- before the user filter (a leaky function could otherwise see filtered-out
-- rows). The filter compares against a sub-SELECT so the setting is read once
-- per query (an InitPlan, handed to parallel workers) rather than once per
-- row; chunk exclusion and the tables' indexes still apply, compressed
-- chunks included.
--
-- The views are made by a function rather than written out here, and
-- 099_read_roles.sh calls it on every migrate run, just before it grants
-- web_app SELECT on them. Rebuilding quantity_rollups (008, documented as
-- re-runnable) drops metric_daily and, by CASCADE, web.metric_daily with it;
-- a base table that gains, loses or retypes a column needs its `SELECT *`
-- view rebuilt. Both repair themselves on the next `docker compose up -d`
-- instead of failing it. A change to the set of views or their filters is a
-- new migration that replaces this function, plus the GRANT and expected
-- rows in 099_read_roles.sh, whose assertion fails the run on any relation
-- in `web` it does not expect.
